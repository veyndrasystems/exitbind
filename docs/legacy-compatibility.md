# Legacy compatibility

Exitbind is the renamed continuation of Soulmate. A new install never meets that
name; this document exists for the cases that do — an old project, an old
ledger, an old executable, or a rollback.

The rule behind every entry below: compatibility reads the old world, and never
relabels its evidence as new evidence.

## Rename history

The rename kept the existing version and repository history rather than
resetting to `0.0.1`. The published tag line, the release assets, and the
run-event format numbers continue across it. See the
[public format map](../CHANGELOG.md#public-tags-and-format-readers) before
choosing a rollback or release channel.

## Old command, config, and state paths

| Historical surface | Current surface | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `soulmate` executable | `exitbind` | Same binary under the previous name; still installed by the legacy installer path |
| `soulmate.json` | `exitbind.json` | Read for existing projects; never created by a current install |
| `.soulmate/` state | `.exitbind/` | Read for existing projects; never created by a current install |
| `soulmate/` control tree | `exitbind/` | Read for existing projects; never created by a current install |
| `.agents/skills/soulmate/`, `.claude/skills/soulmate/` | `.../skills/exitbind/` | Projected only on the legacy surface |
| `SOULMATE_*` environment controls | `EXITBIND_*` | Accepted as a fallback when the current name is unset |
| `systems.veyndra.soulmate/` | `systems.veyndra.exitbind/` | Retained for already-published plugin consumers; not referenced by current onboarding |

A current Exitbind install creates none of the historical spellings. That is a
tested property, not an intention: see `tests/fresh_user_surface.rs`.

## Historical producer and schema guarantees

Run events written by Soulmate carry `producer.name = "soulmate"` and run-event
versions 1 through 4. Exitbind reads them under that identity and leaves the
recorded producer, schema version, and hashes exactly as written. Reading an old
ledger never rewrites it, and a successor run records the current identity
without restating the old one as its own.

Checked runs written by Soulmate use run-event version 3; new Exitbind starts
use version 8, while current readers retain historical versions 1 through 7.
`REFERENCE.md` holds the exact reader and writer matrix.

The immutable schema files `schema/soulmate.schema.json`,
`schema/run-event-v3.schema.json`, and `schema/run-event-v4.schema.json` describe
historical formats and are never edited.

## The hook protocol token

A binary that manages host hooks asks the CLI on `PATH` for its hook protocol
token and refuses to write records it could not have produced. Every published
release compares that token exactly against `soulmate-hook-v1`, so the current
surface keeps emitting the historical spelling: renaming it now would make an
already-published binary reject a newer CLI found on `PATH`.

The current binary already accepts `exitbind-hook-v1` as well. Retirement
criterion: once no supported release older than that change can be the binary
that manages hooks, the emitted token can become `exitbind-hook-v1` and the
historical token moves to read-only acceptance.

Session-hook records are separate from the token. A current install writes only
`exitbind hook-run` records, and installing on the Exitbind surface retires a
superseded `soulmate hook-run` record it recognizes exactly, leaving every other
hook alone.

## Work handles

Work and assignment handles carry the `sma_` prefix. It is an opaque identifier
derived from the previous name, parsed by every published release, and is not
rendered as product identity anywhere in the interface.

## Migration behavior

- An existing project keeps its historical paths; nothing is moved without an
  explicit migration command.
- `exitbind` reads a historical project; the legacy `soulmate` executable keeps
  its original layout so an old invocation never rewrites a project into the new
  spelling.
- Old and new state never mix: a project answers to one configuration, and a new
  run records the current identity only.

## What a later release could retire

- The `soulmate` executable target, once the legacy installer line is withdrawn.
- The `systems.veyndra.soulmate` plugin extension key, once no published consumer
  resolves it.
- The historical hook protocol token, under the criterion above.

None of these can be removed on aesthetics alone; each needs evidence that no
supported consumer depends on it.
