# Changelog

## 0.21.0

- The host bridge can no longer be downgraded by an older process. `exitbind
  update` hands post-update bridge synchronization to the newly installed
  binary, and an up-to-date binary reports what is missing instead of
  reinstalling it. Bridge writes go through the hardened settings writer:
  a path escaping the home root, a directory at the target, or a changed file
  is refused, and file permissions are preserved.
- Legacy hook retirement matches only the two exact published record shapes, so
  a foreign hook that merely mentions the old command is never removed.
- The terminal status line is the product's to write, not the host's. A
  presentation block carries `terminal` - exactly `EXIT READY` when the
  canonical acceptance decision says so, and nothing otherwise - and every work
  response carries that block at the same path: `work next`, `work resume`
  (including when nothing is active and the last run is reported), and the
  decision that reaches the state. Both distributed guidance copies say to
  print the value on a line of its own with nothing attached to it.
- The session context a configured project injects names the terminal rule, so
  a lead that never opens the skill file still knows to print the value it is
  handed rather than compose a sentence around it.
- An acceptance stops speaking for the tree once the tree moves. A terminal
  run's identities are historical, so the terminal block is offered only while
  the exact tested inputs the acceptance was bound to are still the ones on
  disk; the recorded decision stays readable either way.
- `exitbind work resume` reports the most recently finished run when no work is
  active, instead of answering only `no_active_work` and leaving the reader to
  summarise the ledger itself.
- The presentation cache names itself in its own bytes as a derived display
  memo with no authority, and a file that does not is read as nothing and left
  untouched.
- `exitbind work next` and `exitbind work resume` return a `presentation`
  block: percent progress, the exit state, a classified state summary, and at
  most one transition phrase. Reading the same state again says nothing new.
- Progress now divides the check weight by the number of required checks per
  worker, and a review that no longer fits the tested inputs earns no review
  progress.
- `exitbind host install --all` is accepted again; the flag was documented but
  rejected by the argument parser.
- Updating from `v0.20.0` or earlier needs one repair afterwards. That released
  updater re-synchronises the host bridge from its own embedded copy once the
  installer has finished, so the older guidance is left in place; run
  `exitbind host install` once with the new binary, or install directly with the
  installer command. Code already inside a published release cannot be changed,
  so this is a recovery step, not a fix. From this release on, the newly
  installed binary owns that step.
- The presentation cache is written through the hardened managed-file writer and
  read without following symlinks: a file planted at the cache path is refused
  rather than overwritten, and a cache that cannot be read is left untouched and
  treated as absent. Losing the cache can only repeat an optional line; it never
  changes evidence, acceptance, or reuse.
- `exitbind init --refresh-skills` refreshes an Exitbind-managed project skill
  again. It recognised only the previous product's marker, so the command the
  CLI tells operators to run refused its own files.
- Presentation classification is derived from the same canonical run facts the
  work decisions use, so rewording or translating human help can no longer move
  a state or a transition. A partial set of passing checks is no longer reported
  as current.
- Preservation no longer depends on a second installation. The distribution
  carries `skills/exitbind/references/preservation.md`, projects it beside the
  project skill for both hosts, and ships it in the plugin bundle. A governed
  run with accepted requirements resolves its own route and quality - every
  formal task is assigned `FULL` - and returns that assignment in
  `humanHelp.preservationAssignment`. The preservation line now reads
  `Holytail :FULL · FORMAL · evidence=<how the evidence was acquired>`, where
  the evidence axis distinguishes a check Exitbind ran itself from one a host
  reported, and never claims independent verification.
- Temporary files written during normal use are Exitbind-named. The rename
  history moved out of the README into
  [docs/legacy-compatibility.md](docs/legacy-compatibility.md), and a
  regression test proves a fresh install and project show no previous-product
  identity while a historical ledger stays readable under its own.

## 0.20.0

- Installing Exitbind now installs the host bridge the coding-agent lead needs
  to find it. `install.sh` installs or refreshes a managed bootstrap skill for
  each detected host (`~/.codex/skills/exitbind/SKILL.md`,
  `~/.claude/skills/exitbind/SKILL.md`) and the managed session hook, then
  reports what it installed or could not install. A binary installed without a
  usable host bridge is no longer a silent state.
- Add `exitbind host status` and `exitbind host install`. Status reports the
  binary, the bootstrap skill, and the activation hook per host as separate
  observations, and states that discovery is not activation.
- `exitbind update` refreshes a stale managed bootstrap so a current binary
  cannot keep an older host bridge, and reports each refresh.
- Installation retires a superseded `soulmate hook-run` session-hook record on
  the Exitbind surface and keeps every other hook. Files Exitbind does not
  manage - a foreign skill at the same path, a symlink, another tool's hook -
  are reported and never overwritten.
- A session in a repository that is not configured yet now receives a small
  bootstrap context on the Exitbind surface: select Exitbind before
  consequential mutation for material work, keep tiny and read-only work
  direct, request the single initialization write, and do not claim activation
  without a lifecycle action. The legacy Soulmate surface stays silent.
- The unconfigured-project error names the single owner-approved write and its
  exact command instead of a bare instruction.
- Selection remains a host/model judgement. Discovery, selection, activation,
  and governed work are separate observations, and no prompt text forces
  compliance. No persisted format changed.

## 0.19.1

- Fix `exitbind update` on Linux leaving a zero-byte binary after reporting
  success. After the installer replaced the running binary, the updater
  re-derived its caller surface from an executable name that read as deleted,
  switched to the legacy profile, and copied the new binary onto itself. The
  surface is now decided once per process, and an install path is never copied
  onto itself.
- The installer moves a replaced binary aside into one hidden
  `.exitbind-previous-PID/` directory that keeps its file name, so released
  0.18.0 and 0.19.0 updaters no longer truncate the binary this installer
  places. The next install removes earlier aside copies.
- If an earlier update left a zero-byte `exitbind`, reinstall once with the
  pinned installer command in the README.
- No persisted format or public command changes.

## 0.19.0

- Write run-event format 6 for new Exitbind starts. v6 checks, reviewer
  approvals, protections, and lead acceptance record the tested-input identity
  of the product root (`product-root-files-v1`: tracked plus untracked,
  non-ignored files in a Git worktree, or every file otherwise; `.git` and state
  directories excluded). Evidence taken on different inputs is not current, a
  check whose inputs change while it runs records nothing, and acceptance
  recomputes the identity. Ignored files, files outside the product root, the
  environment, and remote or time-dependent conditions are not covered.
- 0.18.0 binaries refuse v6 ledgers; v1-v5 ledgers remain readable under their
  original guarantees and gain no input binding.
- Preservation requirements are v6-only and require a functional check policy;
  the combination without `checkPolicy` is refused at start, successor, and
  replay.
- Residual packets are version 2: the snapshot carries tested-input identity,
  and `humanHelp` is derived from state with `ownerDecision` separate from lead
  actions. Add `work validate WORK --packet FILE`, returning `usable`,
  `refresh_required`, `cannot_establish_applicability`, or `not_continuable`.
  Validation compares every behavior-relevant packet field and always returns
  the canonical packet to act on; only `usable` permits skipping work, and
  nothing in a submitted packet is executed.
- Derive `work next`, `work resume`, `work check`, and `work validate` from one
  run snapshot per request, so the next action, evidence assessment, packet, and
  help describe one ledger revision and one established input context. A failed
  input listing makes dependent evidence unavailable instead of falling back to a
  stored digest.
- Treat terminal runs as history: an accepted, rejected, or blocked run keeps
  its replayable record, but its packet carries no reuse and cannot authorize
  skipping new work after files change.
- No token, model-call, or human-time savings are claimed.

## 0.18.0

- Add deterministic residual packets to `work next` and `work resume`, reporting
  current work identity, subject identity, established facts, still-valid
  evidence, remaining obligations, the next action, and actions the next agent
  should not repeat.
- Let resumed work carry forward a current passed check or approved review when
  the exact subject remains valid, while refusing to reuse stale evidence after
  the subject changes.
- Document the bounded cost-evaluation fixture set for duplicate check/review
  avoidance and stale-subject refusal. No token, model-call, human-time,
  host-startup, or frontier-agent correctness savings are claimed.
- Preserve persisted run-event format 5, historical v1-v4 readers, and the
  existing local-only architecture; no daemon, cloud, database, telemetry, model
  runtime, provider integration, or dependency is introduced.

## 0.17.0

- Rebrand the current public product as Exitbind with the lines “Exitbind — No
  result exits unbound.” and “Bind the evidence to the exact result before
  exit.”
- Add run-event format 5 for new writes, binding an Accepted Subject to the
  exact result and evidence while retaining historical v1–v4 readers and
  `soulmate` producer provenance.
- Retire Coffee as a public feature and brand; readiness guidance belongs to
  the lead surface. Keep OpenCode path-compatible and experimental unless host
  execution is directly observed.
- Preserve the honest limits: local evidence is not tamper-proof, model
  compliance, human adoption, or general project-diff coverage, and no daemon,
  cloud, database, telemetry, model runtime, or new dependency is introduced.

## 0.16.0-rc.1

- Add the agent-first `work begin|next|return|check|resume` façade over the
  existing strict run core. It allocates routine ledgers and artifacts, returns
  opaque handles plus one next action, and keeps low-level `run` commands as the
  advanced interoperability surface.
- Establish a project-scoped selective-use contract: later supported agent
  sessions classify material work, activate Soulmate before scoped mutation,
  keep tiny reversible work direct, and return an explicit blocker when
  selected governed handling cannot activate.
- Separate available, discovered, selected, and activated states in generated
  skill and setup guidance. Fresh initialization now refuses stale managed
  projections instead of claiming exact embedded bytes and points to the
  explicit skill-refresh path.
- Move the complete low-level, recovery, and evidence guidance into a delayed
  reference while keeping the always-loaded skill focused on selection,
  authority, and the normal high-level path.
- Make bridge assumptions explicit in Reality claims guidance: keep endpoint
  facts distinct, test the connecting edge, and bind evidence to its target.
- Preserve run-event formats and existing v1-v4 readers; no migration, daemon,
  model runtime, permission grant, or new dependency is introduced.

## 0.15.0-rc.3

- Bound local `run observe-check` execution with a configurable timeout, run it
  outside the ledger lock, terminate its POSIX process group on timeout, and
  revalidate the complete durable binding before append.
- Distinguish locally observed, host-reported, and mixed check acquisition in
  human status while keeping check, review, and lead acceptance separate.
- Route setup-purpose agents from contributor instructions to README onboarding
  and keep Coffee's context guidance role-based.

## 0.15.0-rc.2

- Separate human contribution guidance from repository instructions for coding
  agents and keep Coffee independent of private tool-stack vocabulary.
- Select the contributor and CI Rust toolchain once in `rust-toolchain.toml`
  while retaining the package MSRV as a distinct Cargo contract.

## 0.15.0-rc.1

- Add checked run-event format 4 and `run observe-check`, which records a
  locally observed frozen command with separate acquisition and exit/signal
  result evidence while retaining v3 caller-reported ledgers.
- Reject replayed check events after terminal run state and clarify that update
  and skill diagnostics do not establish host-cache or active-session reload.
- Lead the public README with conversation-first, URL-first setup while keeping
  selective governed work, prerelease consent, and direct simple work explicit.

## 0.14.0-rc.4

- Lead with the existing host conversation, selective project preferences, and direct ordinary work while keeping setup and protocol boundaries explicit.
- Add fresh StateRoot ledger-path guidance and document current observe-path and migration-mode limits with focused regression coverage.

## 0.14.0-rc.3

- Clarify empty starter boundaries, update rollback diagnostics, and align the benchmark and setup guidance with their observable behavior.

## 0.14.0-rc.2

- Add a disposable behavioral-evaluation rubric that records observable probe and mutation ordering without claiming agent behavior or product benefit.

## 0.14.0-rc.1

- Add target-bound readiness guidance before materially costly dependent work or cutover while safe independent work continues.
- Lead the installer to the setup-free benchmark before portable project initialization.
- Align plugin presentation with the public product statement and correct the portable-root manifest schema usage; plugin installation does not install the separate CLI.
- Add an active SessionStart agent advisory for newer public releases and an explicit `soulmate update` path; neither performs an automatic install.
- Use a disposable user cache with bounded public release metadata; no persisted-format, dependency, or migration change is claimed.

## 0.13.0-rc.1

- Add canonical Soulmate guidance for bounded reality claims and decision closure.

## 0.12.1-rc.3

- Ship the `v0.12.1-rc.3` prerelease from source snapshot `4199ebd`, with native builds, packaged installation, and public asset installation validated for Linux x86_64 and both Mac architectures; WSL exercises the same Linux artifact inside Ubuntu. See [platform support details](docs/platform-support.md) and [public release workflow](https://github.com/veyndrasystems/soulmate/actions/runs/34094355184).
- Show current worker claims, host-reported checks, reviewer findings, and actual lead decisions in the human status and explanation views. A protocol refusal remains distinct from lead rejection; machine JSON and persisted records retain their existing shape.
- Add read-only skill diagnostics and documentation navigation and guidance. No schema, authority, or stable-policy change is claimed; no persisted migration is required.
- Frame the preview as a conditional choice for teams that want an inspectable acceptance record after handoffs or rework. Existing native worker/reviewer spawn capability must be confirmed by the coordinating host before a run; a profile, task name, or plan-only brief is not proof, and an unavailable tool returns pending work without a substitute executor. This is host guidance, not binary enforcement.

## Public tags and format readers

For a checked run using run-event format 3, retain a **0.12.0 or later
compatible binary**. For format 4, retain **0.15.0-rc.1 or later**. Inspect with
`soulmate run inspect LEDGER --config CONFIG`; do not edit a ledger's format
number to make a downgrade work.

This frozen map covers selected public format-transition and retained-reader
tags observed through `v0.15.0-rc.3` at commit `4faf2a7`. Reader support below
is established from tagged source; current-reader tests also replay frozen
historical fixtures. It is not a claim that every older downloaded binary was
re-executed during this review.

The parentless public root `a0b8be3` contains package 0.10.0 without a
corresponding public release tag in this observed map. Earlier changelog
entries describe development history, not publicly reconstructable release
objects. They attribute receipt 2 / harness manifest 1 to 0.4.0 and run events 2
to 0.7.0; the original archived trees are not asserted equivalent to public tags.
Private archives, refs, and operational evidence remain intentionally
unpublished. See [the public history boundary](docs/public-history.md).

## 0.12.1-rc.2

- Lead with the existing setup-free experiment: `soulmate benchmark` runs a disposable
  configuration-repair example with real local checks and scripted actors.
  Its readable result shows the worker claim, failed check, reviewer approval,
  refused lead acceptance, rework, and the fresh accepted attempt.
- Lead the README with the installed-binary experiment, then an explicit
  `soulmate init --mode portable` project setup and a handoff naming the
  generated skill and configuration for the existing coding-agent host.
  Setup does not activate agents or grant host permissions.
- Exercise the literal README journey in a Git-initialized fixture while
  preserving the user's project and the explicit Git initialization guard.
- Preserve commands, JSON, proof scenarios, and persisted formats. Stable
  0.12.0 remains available; this preview correction adds no product invariant,
  stable-policy change, or migration. Synthetic checks establish observed
  refusal and recovery, not human time savings or universal installation payback.

## 0.12.1-rc.1

- Preview the optional `run submit --event-id` and `run next --text` forms,
  checked-start guidance, read-only next actions, and executable rework example.
  Default JSON and persisted formats retain their existing contracts.
- Lead the README with an existing-host task and real check. Bundle guidance
  for concise results with inspectable evidence, and describe initialization
  as preparing skills rather than activating agents.
- Report the bounded native/Soulmate pilots, including a real bug first found
  by the native baseline and missed by an initially accepted Soulmate run.
  These results do not establish better code or lower operator cost.
- This is a prerelease of compatible presentation additions. The current stable
  version policy does not classify these additions; no new product invariant
  or stable-policy change is claimed. Stable 0.12.0 remains available, with its
  JSON workflow. Upgrade the binary before using the new flags, then explicitly
  refresh managed skills. No persisted migration is required.

## 0.12.0

- Add opt-in checked acceptance: freeze a check command at run start and bind
  caller-reported results to exact current worker submission events. Missing
  or failed results prevent canonical acceptance, including during replay.
  The host executes checks; reported success is not authenticated execution,
  reviewer approval, or final acceptance.
- Add status, explanation, and redacted local aggregate views, plus a
  token-free `soulmate benchmark` scenario that reproduces refusal and fresh
  rework recovery. Synthetic command counts and elapsed execution do not
  establish human time saved or recurring production incidents.
- Checked runs use run-event format 3. Ordinary v1/v2 runs keep their existing
  format and read behavior. Older binaries reject v3; retain a compatible
  binary to inspect checked evidence and never downgrade a ledger by editing
  its version. No mandatory runtime or dependency is added.
- Link the scoped public claim to its executable proof and pin versioned proof
  schemas in CI. The minor version follows the existing invariant rule: a
  configured failed-check counterexample previously accepted is now refused.

- Strengthen contributor release-reference checks and pin the retained public
  ancestry in CI. Document the existing history boundary and separate retention
  rules from publication permission. Product behavior and version policy are
  unchanged by those contributor-only checks.

## 0.11.0

- Made native conversation preservation an explicit host-guidance invariant:
  profiles, briefs, run records, and governed memory augment the active root
  conversation. They do not authorize replacing it or discarding recent user
  corrections, rejected approaches, or their rationale.
- Session-start hooks present the same bounded advisory distinction. Executable
  hook and generated-skill regression checks cover the behavior Soulmate owns.
- Added a diagnostic guide that separates thread replacement, compaction,
  injected context, and host/client integration hypotheses.
- This is synchronized guidance and tested local hook behavior, not proof of
  model compliance or resolution of a historical host-memory regression.
- Migration: update host guidance with the supported skill-refresh path. No
  CLI command, configuration, persisted format, dependency, or model runtime
  changes are introduced. The minor version records the new product invariant
  under the repository's versioning policy.

## 0.10.0

- Attended implementation workers and reviewers must now use the host's native
  subagent spawn with the assignment's exact native task name; when that spawn
  is unavailable, stop and return the pending assignment to the operator. This
  is synchronized host guidance, not Soulmate enforcement of host execution.
- `soulmate away` remains reserved for an explicit operator-away or disconnect
  continuation; the Rust away runtime is unchanged.
- Corrected hook-output home-path redaction so machine-local paths stay
  redacted while the public source remains safe for publication.
- Migration: update attended workflow handoffs to native spawn. This release
  adds no CLI, configuration, persisted schema or format, dependency, or
  runtime expansion.

## 0.9.3

- Removed the unsupported context-observation collector and report from the
  product tree and release binary. The implementation remains available for
  transparent development only on `experiment/context-observability`; locally
  collected diagnostic data remains private and is never published.
- Local-mode hooks now resolve the exact ControlRoot through the private
  machine binding while confirming that the hook ProductRoot still matches;
  repeating `soulmate bind` upgrades compatible older bindings in place.

## 0.9.2

- Added strict private ingestion of exact host-reported usage for internal
  context dogfooding, correlated to content-free run and assignment identities.
- Reports exact repeated and still-pending assignment invocations without
  treating an invocation as completion, success, or authority to skip work.
- Rejects malformed, duplicated, rerouted, unsafe, unmatched, and concurrently
  stale diagnostic evidence while leaving the default CLI and canonical
  persisted formats unchanged.

## 0.9.1

- Added non-default, private context-accounting dogfood instrumentation that
  measures only Soulmate-owned byte boundaries and keeps model/provider usage,
  host context, and broader optimization claims explicitly unknown.
- Hardened authority classification for mixed payloads and run-scoped
  observations without changing the default CLI or canonical persisted
  formats.

## 0.9.0

- Native away recovery now records the explicit or unknown sandbox posture and
  distinguishes exit codes from signal termination. Completion requires the
  exact stage, attempt, and agent submission event; merely leaving the pending
  set is reported separately.
- Path inputs used by commands, identifiers, or recorded evidence now reject
  non-UTF-8 rendering and unresolved working directories instead of silently
  substituting or collapsing paths. A repository allowlist gate prevents the
  rejected patterns from returning.
- Release and plugin manifests now share one version identity, and tag
  publication runs the release-reference gate before building artifacts.

## 0.8.0

- New projects and explicit `migrate paths` runs prepare the complete public
  `soulmate/` and private `.soulmate/` directory contract while retaining
  legacy manifest and evidence bytes.
- `doctor` now distinguishes a direct dotagents command from uninvoked
  `npx`/`agents.toml` observations.
- Clarified that external task handoffs are incomplete unless exact observe,
  write, and command authority arrives as structured fields rather than guide
  prose.
- Separated authoritative assignment contract, reviewed profile guidance,
  context-only memory, and evidence-only harness/artifact claims in the native
  away prompt, with instruction-like adversarial fixtures and security limits.
- Added an explicit deterministic `migrate layout` dry-run/apply path for
  configured `.agents/profiles/` sources. It refuses symlinks, collisions, and
  tracked or staged mutations while leaving historical evidence untouched.
- `run supersede` now permits one provenance-bound successor from a terminal
  `blocked` run while preserving immutable predecessor bytes and continuing to
  reject `accepted` and `rejected` predecessors.
- New portable and local projects, plus newly imported profiles, now keep
  canonical agent profiles under `soulmate/agents/`; existing configurations
  that reference `.agents/profiles/` remain valid and are never rewritten.
- Documented the Soulmate-centered directory contract while retaining
  `.agents/` for optional distribution and `.codex/`/`.claude/` for host-owned
  projections.

## 0.7.0

- Added opt-in run-event version 2, which binds an existing receipt-v2 harness
  record by StateRoot-relative path and exact SHA-256 while retaining generation
  and inspection of unbound version-1 runs.
- Added native `soulmate away` start/list/show commands. The single Rust binary
  now revalidates config, selected profile/runtime, boundary, memory, upstream
  artifacts, receipt, and exact manifest claims across an isolated tmux launch.
- Removed the project-copied Python away adapter and its Python CI dependency;
  0.6 scripts migrate to `soulmate away` without changing receipt/config shapes
  or the canonical `run submit` evidence path.
- Added fail-closed receipt/manifest drift, mixed-event-version, plan-coverage,
  zero-Codex-launch, recovery-state privacy, and real-tmux regression coverage.

## 0.6.0

- Added an optional, project-scoped Codex+tmux reference adapter that keeps one
  already-authorized pending assignment alive across an operator disconnect.
- Kept normal `run next`/`run submit` ledger evidence canonical; adapter status
  is private process-recovery evidence and no daemon, provider client, second
  JSONL store, persisted schema, or dependency was added.
- Revalidates the exact assignment, profile, memory hashes, runtime choice, and
  fresh StateRoot artifact path before launch; rejects fallback selection and a
  second same-host launch of the same live assignment.

## 0.5.0

- Made generated and published schema references follow the crate version while
  accepting older advisory harness `$schema` values for manifest version 1.
- Clarified that `independently_verified` records an off-box claim whose format
  is validated and bound, without hashing a local artifact or authenticating a
  verifier; SHA-256 inputs must be lowercase hexadecimal.
- Hardened onboarding path errors, documented fixed evidence shapes and the
  canonical-root precondition, and clarified macOS source-test-only support.

## 0.4.0

- Added an opt-in, versioned harness manifest that hash-binds portable project
  and session identifiers, harness identity, and bounded skill, perspective,
  and Ponytail activation evidence into the existing canonical receipt without
  copying raw manifest strings.
- Added receipt version 2 for harness-bound receipts while retaining version 1
  generation and verification when no manifest is supplied.
- Kept evidence levels explicit (`configured`, `presented`, `agent_declared`,
  `hook_observed`, and `independently_verified`) without treating presentation
  or declaration as proof of agent compliance.
- Rejects unknown manifest fields and free-form content; prompts, goals,
  transcripts, secrets, raw environment values, and unrelated project content
  are not accepted or copied into receipts.

## 0.3.0

- Removed the legacy Node implementation and moved publication privacy and
  compatibility coverage into Rust tests with frozen v0.0.8, v0.1.x, and
  v0.2.x ledger fixtures.
- Hardened Git worktree preflight against non-UTF-8 paths, missing Git,
  command failure, and inconsistent tracked/staged failure handling.
- Removed external-input panic paths from boundary, CLI JSON, timestamp, and
  memory path handling; `--json` failures now remain parseable.
- Continued the typed configuration transition for boundary, receipt, runtime,
  and memory selection without changing persisted receipt, ledger, or config
  shapes.
- Reorganized the bundled skill around recovery branches and distinguished
  configured, presented, agent-declared, hook-observed, and independently
  verified harness evidence in existing submitted artifacts.
- Pinned generated schema/install references to the release tag, added Linux
  dependency audit and macOS test coverage, and reduced duplicated README
  limitation prose in favor of the security boundary document.

## 0.2.1

- Fixed empty CLI invocation and added conventional `--help` and `--version`
  entrypoints without changing existing subcommand parsing.
- Added content-free memory-budget refusal diagnostics with the attempted
  item/byte totals at refusal and configured limits; strict no-truncation
  behavior is unchanged.
- Began a gradual typed configuration transition at the validated agent/runtime
  boundary while preserving raw configuration bytes and persisted formats.
- Added GitHub artifact provenance attestation and release-workflow verification
  for the packaged archive, while retaining installer SHA-256 checksum checks.
- Clarified that root Node files are preserved v0.0.8 compatibility/privacy
  fixtures, not a supported installed runtime.
- Fixed skill refresh to restore missing managed copies and report created,
  refreshed, or unchanged destinations truthfully after complete preflight.

## 0.2.0

- Added explicit portable and local repository modes with typed ControlRoot,
  ProductRoot, and StateRoot ownership, private machine-local project bindings,
  and Git preflight refusal for tracked or staged runtime state.
- Added exact run-scoped observe/write manifests that can only narrow configured
  maxima, remain hash-linked across resume, and fail closed on manifest drift.
- Added warning-level placeholder diagnostics and focused local-mode,
  publication-boundary, narrowing, drift, and parallel-assignment tests.
- Added immutable, attempt-scoped StateRoot artifact hints and explicit
  `--artifact-root state` submissions so rework does not overwrite prior
  evidence.
- Added producer version/commit evidence to newly created receipts and ledger
  events while preserving inspection of older records without that field.
- Updated Rust examples and CI, declared Rust 1.75 as the MSRV, and prevented
  release workflows from overwriting existing tag assets.

- Added opt-in, project-scoped recall of accepted memory evidence through a
  shallow bounded ledger root and exact per-agent scope/context filtering.
- Added content-free `memory resolve` output and deterministic memory references
  in briefs, plans, and native-host run assignments; source bytes remain in
  operator-owned project files, while the bundled skill requires exact reads
  immediately before a matching subagent spawn.
- Frozen run references now fail closed on source, lifecycle, ledger-head, or
  selection drift without breaking inspection of existing v0.0.8/v0.1.0
  ledgers.
- Supersession now rolls back only its own newly created predecessor claim when
  successor creation fails, so a corrected retry is not stranded.
- Kept semantic search and embeddings out of core; any future optional ranker
  may operate only after lifecycle and authorization eligibility.

## 0.1.0

- Replaced the user-facing Node.js runtime with a Rust 2021 single binary.
- Added Cargo build metadata, embedded skills, release artifacts, checksums,
  and an initially Linux x86_64 installer.
- Preserved the v0.0.8 JSON configuration, receipt, JSONL run, and memory
  evidence formats; Node files remain only as migration reference fixtures.
- Kept configuration drift fail closed and added explicit `run supersede`
  provenance: a new bounded ledger links to a verified predecessor head while
  leaving the predecessor unchanged and sealed against later submissions.
- Clarified that role outcomes are evidence records, not votes or proof of
  multi-agent consensus; the configured lead retains final acceptance authority.
- Initially support Linux x86_64 release artifacts; unsupported platforms fail
  before download rather than receiving an unverified cross-compiled binary.

## 0.0.8

- Added explicit `soulmate init --with-coffee` and matching refresh support to
  install the bundled Coffee skill for Codex and Claude without changing the
  default Soulmate-only initialization path.
- Added all-selected-destination preflight and regression coverage so Coffee
  opt-in refuses conflicts before writing any selected skill file.
- Documented a narrow Venus interoperability boundary: cross-session
  orientation stays advisory and human-narrowed, while Soulmate owns only the
  active task's bounded handoff and run evidence.

## 0.0.7

- Repair the public CI installed-package smoke test by creating its isolated
  project root before initialization.
- Route CI privacy checks through Soulmate's tested, fail-closed privacy gate
  so adversarial test fixtures are not mistaken for release leaks.

## 0.0.6

- Added resumable `run start|next|submit|inspect` lifecycle evidence with
  role-aware transitions, rework attempts, artifact hashes, drift checks,
  bounded assignment batches, and conservative project-local lock recovery.
- Added bundled native-host adapter guidance: capable hosts perform native
  spawning and review while the CLI remains provider-free and records only
  declared evidence and submitted artifacts.
- Added private `.soulmate/` run state with an ignored contents boundary and a
  repository privacy gate; the gate is a publication check, not proof of
  purging local or untracked data.
- Added portable profile audit/import with redacted findings and conservative
  zero-right defaults for reusing agent briefs outside their original project.
- Added stable, display, and native agent-name mapping without claiming that a
  host-generated thread label or ID is controlled by Soulmate.
- Added strict retention and cross-context values plus content-free local
  forgetting-attestation receipts for already-absent terminal memory items.
- `soulmate init` now installs the bundled skill into project-scoped Codex and
  Claude discovery paths; explicit `--refresh-skills` updates only marked
  Soulmate-owned copies, while npm installation alone changes no host config.

## 0.0.5

- Added role-scoped memory proposal, review, promotion, rejection, revocation,
  and expiry evidence as part of Soulmate's agent-handoff boundary.
- Kept Coffee as an optional portable preparation skill that can feed the
  existing agent `skills`, brief, and plan flow without adding a second
  subsystem.
- Added one-item append-only JSONL ledgers with hash-linked transition events
  referencing operator-owned project files without copying their contents.
- Kept the runtime dependency-free with no Coffee CLI or configuration
  subsystem, daemon, database, embeddings, telemetry, provider client,
  background expiry, or external tool execution.

## 0.0.4

- Registry onboarding and documentation release: npm installation is now the
  primary quick-start path, with the tagged GitHub source retained as a
  fallback for source-based installs.
- Kept dotagents and Codex/Claude hooks optional and advanced; no feature or
  dependency changes.
- Normalized the npm executable path so publication no longer needs manifest
  correction.

## 0.0.3

- Simplified standalone onboarding: install the pinned GitHub release, run
  `soulmate init`, and render a first brief without dotagents or hooks.
- Clarified that Node.js 20+ is the sole runtime requirement and moved dotagents,
  host hooks, and model bindings into optional or advanced integrations.
- Updated `init` next-step output to point to the standalone first-value command.

## 0.0.2

- Added explicit project-local Codex and Claude hook plan/apply/status/remove
  commands with idempotent, per-file atomic, conflict-safe settings merges.
- Added the internal `hook-run` bridge for bounded SessionStart and
  SubagentStart context; it is fail-open when Soulmate is unavailable.
- Added a pre-install hook-protocol handshake and five-second native hook
  timeout so stale commands or a stuck bridge cannot become a startup bottleneck.
- Preserved host settings, rejected malformed or escaping hook paths, and
  documented the bounded multi-file rename limitation.

## 0.0.1

- Added the dependency-free, plan-only CLI for config checks, briefs, plans,
  profiles, onboarding, and opt-in receipt verification.
- Added a valid Agent Plugins v1 portable bundle with role-specific skills;
  preserved SessionStart/SubagentStart host-hook resources are separated under
  a reverse-domain extension namespace and are not activated by installation.
- Added explicit runtime binding metadata without model routing, invocation,
  credentials, or implicit fallback.
- Receipts now contain selected config/profile bytes and requested runtime
  metadata only; task and goal fingerprints are not stored.
- Memory fields remain declarations of policy intent only; no storage,
  promotion, expiry, deletion, or revocation is performed.
